# Skm@555 - Yin Yang ☯️ CSS Animation


## Overview

This project demonstrates a rotating **Yin Yang** symbol using pure CSS for animation. The symbol is created using borders, shadows, and CSS keyframes to achieve the signature black-and-white circular design, which spins infinitely.

## Files

1. `index.html` - The main HTML file that structures the page.
2. `styles.css` - The CSS file that contains all the styling and animations.
3. `script.js` - A placeholder JavaScript file (currently unused).

## How It Works

The **Yin Yang** symbol is created by layering two halves: one black and one white, with additional circular shapes inside to represent the classic design. The animation is applied using CSS `@keyframes` to continuously rotate the symbol.

## Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the rotating **Yin Yang** symbol.
2. Customize the rotation speed or design by adjusting the CSS in the `styles.css` file.
3. No JavaScript is required for this animation, but you can extend it with interactions or additional effects if desired.

## Preview

The animation features a rotating **Yin Yang** symbol, representing balance and harmony, rotating counterclockwise every 2.5 seconds.

## Customization

- Modify the `@keyframes` rule in the `styles.css` file to adjust the rotation speed.
- Change the border colors or box shadows to give the symbol a different appearance or add effects.
